# JudgeScoreAverager v1.0.2

Judge Score Averager is the first C# program I've ever made in Visual C#. It allows users to take scores from multiple judges of a contest and average them out for a final score. 

## Features
* Unlimited amount of Judges.
* Highscore to prevent any scores from going higher than the set one.
* Simple instructions.
* Averages out to the 3rd decimal point. (if applicable.)
